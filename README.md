# Task Manager

---

**Project Objective**

*The purpose of this project is to assign tasks to employees at companies and monitor the time taken to complete them.*

---

**Project Overview**

Each employee is assigned specific tasks at their workplace. When starting a task, the employee clicks the **Start** button and, upon completion, categorizes the task using various statuses. This process allows the company to keep track of the working time, and also reminds the employee of the deadline set for task completion.

The project implementation is divided into **two stages**:

1. **Telegram Bots**
    - [Corporate Bot](https://t.me/tm_corporate_bot)
    - [Employee Bot](https://t.me/tm_employee_bot)

2. **Web Site for Corporations and Mobile App for Employees**
