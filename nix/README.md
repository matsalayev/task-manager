# What is this?
This is an opinionated [Nix](https://nixos.org/) [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for getting started with the [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) programming language. It creates a development subshell with the following Scala tools on the path:

* [Ammonite](https://ammonite.io/)
* [Bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/)
* [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/)
* [GraalVM CE](https://www.graalvm.org/) based on [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) 21
* [Mill](https://com-lihaoyi.github.io/mill/mill/Intro_to_Mill.html)
* [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)
* [Scalafmt CLI](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/)

In fact it can create alternative subshells with these instead:
* [Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) 17
* [Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) 11
* [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/) 8

The first time you use this subshell these tools will be downloaded and cached. Once you exit the subshell they will no longer be on your path. The second run is instantaneous.

# Prerequisites
Due to [this issue](https://github.com/scalacenter/bloop/issues/1467) [bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/) is not published for arm processors yet so you'll need to install [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861) if you are on Apple silicon:
```bash
/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

# Installation
1. Install the Nix package manager by selecting your OS in the [official guide](https://nixos.org/download.html). Don't forget to reopen the terminal!

1. Enable the flakes feature:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
    echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
    ```
    If the Nix installation is in multi-user mode, donâ€™t forget to restart the `nix-daemon` by running:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon
    ```
# Alternative unofficial installation
Taken from https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

# Usage
For [direnv](https://direnv.net/)/[nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) users put the following into your `.envrc`:
```bash
use flake ./nix#17
```
